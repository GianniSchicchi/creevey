Phoenix Slides source code README
by Dominic Yu
2005 June 8

creevey was the code name for Phoenix Slides. Colin Creevey is the
kid in Harry Potter who keeps taking pictures.

Sorry for the messy source code. I've tried to make things modular
and reusable, though a lot of classes are rather application-specific.
Let's see, the wrapping matrix is kinda cool. The dir browser could
be useful (but NSBrowser is a horrible, horrible class). And the
Carbon Goodies are definitely useful.

If anyone wants to contribute their coding talent and make this
program come along more quickly, help is always welcome. TO DO:
jpeg lossless rotation, show exif info,
generate web pages, play movies.

Enjoy!

Version History
---------------
1.1
info bar
resize thumbnails
change (single-)selection in matrix using arrow keys
speed/memory optimizations in wrapping matrix
- now reuses a single NSImageCell
- setNeedsDisplayInRect redraws only what's needed (selections are faster)
fixed view/thread bugs (setNeedsDisplay is not thread-safe)
animated GIFs - ridiculously simple to implement.
dir listing shows volumes at the top level
dir listing updates on volume mounting, dir renaming/deletion
space now pause/continues auto-advance
pressing 1-9 now starts auto-advance right away
added scale up for small images

While optimizing the drawing in the wrapping matrix,
I discovered another Apple bug: needsToDrawRect: sometimes
returns NO when it should return YES. Supposedly fixed in 10.4,
and it's documented (TN2107), but it took me a while to figure out.


1.0
---
first release, day before Tiger (2005.04.28 Thursday).

As of June 12, there've been about 800 downloads. ONE person
has emailed me thanking me for the program. I guess that means
no one's found anything wrong with it...

The most annoying bugs are the ones in Apple's frameworks.
NSBrowser seems to crash if you click on it too much (something
about the horizontal scrolling animation). I've made a poser subclass
to disable the animation.
